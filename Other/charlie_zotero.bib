	abstract = {This is a report on the status and prospects of the quantification of neutrino properties through the cosmological neutrino background for the Cosmic Frontier of the Division of Particles and Fields Community Summer Study long-term planning exercise. Experiments planned and underway are prepared to study the cosmological neutrino background in detail via its influence on distance-redshift relations and the growth of structure. The program for the next decade described in this document, including upcoming spectroscopic galaxy surveys {eBOSS} and {DESI} and a new Stage-{IV} {CMB} polarization experiment {CMB}-S4, will achieve sigma(sum m\_nu) = 16 {meV} and sigma(N\_eff) = 0.020. Such a mass measurement will produce a high significance detection of non-zero sum m\_nu, whose lower bound derived from atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillation data is about 58 {meV}. If neutrinos have a minimal normal mass hierarchy, this measurement will definitively rule out the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy, shedding light on one of the most puzzling aspects of the Standard Model of particle physics --- the origin of mass. This precise a measurement of N\_eff will allow for high sensitivity to any light and dark degrees of freedom produced in the big bang and a precision test of the standard cosmological model prediction that N\_eff = 3.046.},

The principle of the instrument is based upon the correlation between the rectified outputs of two independent receivers at each end of a baseline, and it is shown that the cross-correlation coefficient between these outputs is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the Fourier transform of the intensity distribution across the source. The analysis shows that it should be possible to operate the new instrument with extremely long baselines and that it should be almost unaffected by ionospheric irregularities.},

	abstract = {A waveplate or retarder is an optical device that alters the polarization state of a light wave travelling through it. Two common types of waveplates are the half-wave plate, which shifts the polarization direction of linearly polarized light, and the quarter-wave plate, which converts linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light and vice versa. A quarter-wave plate can be used to produce elliptical polarization as well.
Waveplates are constructed out of a birefringent material (such as quartz or mica, or even plastic), for which the index of refraction is different for light linearly polarized along one or the other of two certain perpendicular crystal axes. The behavior of a waveplate (that is, whether it is a half-wave plate, a quarter-wave plate, etc.) depends on the thickness of the crystal, the wavelength of light, and the variation of the index of refraction. By appropriate choice of the relationship between these parameters, it is possible to introduce a controlled phase shift between the two polarization components of a light wave, thereby altering its polarization.A common use of waveplates—particularly the sensitive-tint (full-wave) and quarter-wave plates—is in optical mineralogy. Addition of plates between the polarizers of a petrographic microscope makes easier the optical identification of minerals in thin sections of rocks, in particular by allowing deduction of the shape and orientation of the optical indicatrices within the visible crystal sections. This alignment can allow discrimination between minerals which otherwise appear very similar in plane polarized and cross polarized light.},

By increasing optical loading on the detectors, it amplifies their effective noise, while its fluctuations introduce spatial and temporal correlations between detected signals. We present a physically motivated 3D-model of the atmosphere total intensity emission in the millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelengths. We derive a new analytical estimate for the correlation between detectors time-ordered data as a function of the instrument and survey design, as well as several atmospheric parameters such as wind, relative humidity, temperature and turbulence characteristics. Using an original numerical computation, we examine the effect of each physical parameter on the correlations in the time series of a given experiment. We then use a parametric-likelihood approach to validate the modeling and estimate atmosphere parameters from the polarbear-i project first season data set. We derive a new 1.0\% upper limit on the linear polarization fraction of atmospheric emission. We also compare our results to previous studies and weather station measurements. The proposed model can be used for realistic simulations of future ground-based {CMB} observations.},

Many physical sources, both primary and secondary ones, are adequately approximated by this model. Coherence and radiometric properties of light generated by such sources (assumed, for simplicity, to be planar) are discussed and an important reciprocity relation is shown to exist between light in the far zone and in the source plane. This relation implies that the degree of coherence in the far zone is given by the classic form of the van Cittert-Zernike theorem, even though the source may have a high degree of spatial coherence over arbitrarily large areas. The reciprocity relation also provides a generalization of a recently derived result that expresses the angular dependence of the radiant intensity in terms of the degree of spatial coherence of light in the source plane. The dependence of all the basic radiometric quantities on the distribution of the optical intensity across the source and on the degree of spatial coherence of the light emerging from the source is discussed and is illustrated, for some typical sources, by computed curves.},

Because of the large range of wavelengths for which such detectors are applicable, the size of a pixel (p) relative to the wavelength (λ) will vary according to the specific application of a given available technology. As the pixel size becomes comparable to a wavelength of the absorbed radiation, correlations in the radiation field at the pixel can affect the imaging properties of the system independent of the correlations introduced by the front-end optics. We study the dependence of image fidelity and induced polarization on the size of the pixel by employing a formalism in which diffraction due to the pixel boundary is treated by propagating the second-order statistical correlations of the radiation field through an optical system. We construct simulated polarized images of square pixels for various ratios of p/λ. For the limit in which few modes are supported by the pixel (p/λ ≲ 1), we find that the diffraction due to the pixel edges is nonnegligible and hence must be considered along with the telescope diffraction pattern in modeling the ultimate spatial resolution of an imaging system. For the case in which the pixel is over-moded (p/λ≫1), the geometric limit is approached as expected. This technique provides a quantitative approach to understand and optimize the imaging properties of planar detectors in the few-mode limit.},

In order to keep the classical limit of quantum electrodynamics plainly in view, extensive use is made of the coherent states of the field. These states, which reduce the field correlation functions to factorized forms, are shown to offer a convenient basis for the description of fields of all types. Although they are not orthogonal to one another, the coherent states form a complete set. It is shown that any quantum state of the field may be expanded in terms of them in a unique way. Expansions are also developed for arbitrary operators in terms of products of the coherent state vectors. These expansions are discussed as a general method of representing the density operator for the field. A particular form is exhibited for the density operator which makes it possible to carry out many quantum-mechanical calculations by methods resembling those of classical theory. This representation permits clear insights into the essential distinction between the quantum and classical descriptions of the field. It leads, in addition, to a simple formulation of a superposition law for photon fields. Detailed discussions are given of the incoherent fields which are generated by superposing the outputs of many stationary sources. These fields are all shown to have intimately related properties, some of which have been known for the particular case of blackbody radiation.},

	abstract = {Characterization of the Cosmic Microwave Background ({CMB}) B-mode 
polarization signal will test models of inflationary cosmology, as well
as constrain the sum of the neutrino masses and other cosmological
parameters. The low intensity of the B-mode signal combined with the
need to remove polarized galactic foregrounds requires a sensitive
millimeter receiver and effective methods of foreground removal. Current
bolometric detector technology is reaching the sensitivity limit set by
the {CMB} photon noise. Thus, we need to increase the optical throughput
to increase an experiment's sensitivity. To increase the throughput
without increasing the focal plane size, we can increase the frequency
coverage of each pixel. Increased frequency coverage per pixel has
additional advantage that we can split the signal into frequency bands
to obtain spectral information. The detection of multiple frequency
bands allows for removal of the polarized foreground emission from
synchrotron radiation and thermal dust emission, by utilizing its
spectral dependence. Traditionally, spectral information has been
captured with a multi-chroic focal plane consisting of a heterogeneous
mix of single-color pixels. To maximize the efficiency of the focal
plane area, we developed a multi-chroic pixel. This increases the number
of pixels per frequency with same focal plane area. We developed
multi-chroic antenna-coupled transition edge sensor ({TES}) detector array
for the {CMB} polarimetry. In each pixel, a silicon lens-coupled dual
polarized sinuous antenna collects light over a two-octave frequency
band. The antenna couples the broadband millimeter wave signal into
microstrip transmission lines, and on-chip filter banks split the
broadband signal into several frequency bands. Separate {TES} bolometers
detect the power in each frequency band and linear polarization. We will
describe the design and performance of these devices and present optical
data taken with prototype pixels and detector arrays. Our measurements
show beams with percent level ellipticity, percent level
cross-polarization leakage, and partitioned bands using banks of two and
three filters. We will also describe the development of broadband
anti-reflection coatings for the high dielectric constant lens. The
broadband anti-reflection coating has approximately 100\% bandwidth and
no detectable loss at cryogenic temperature. We will describe a next
generation {CMB} polarimetry experiment, the {POLARBEAR}-2, in detail. The
{POLARBEAR}-2 would have focal planes with kilo-pixel of these detectors
to achieve high sensitivity. We'll also introduce proposed experiments
that would use multi-chroic detector array we developed in this work.
We'll conclude by listing out suggestions for future multichroic
detector development.},

	abstract = {{CMB}-S4 is a proposed experiment to map the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background ({CMB}) to nearly the cosmic variance limit for angular scales that are accessible from the ground. The science goals and capabilities of {CMB}-S4 in illuminating cosmic inflation, measuring the sum of neutrino masses, searching for relativistic relics in the early universe, characterizing dark energy and dark matter, and mapping the matter distribution in the universe have been described in the {CMB}-S4 Science Book. This Technology Book is a companion volume to the Science Book. The ambitious science goals of {CMB}-S4, a "Stage-4" experiment, require a step forward in experimental capability from the current Stage={II} experiments. To guide this process, we summarize the current state of {CMB} instrumentation technology, and identify R\&D efforts necessary to advance it for use in {CMB}-S4. The book focuses on technical challenges in four broad areas: Telescope Design; Receiver Optics; Focal-Plane Optical Coupling; and Focal-Plane Sensor and Readout.},

The band powers are reported over angular multipoles \$500 {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}ell {\textbackslash}leq 2100\$, where the dominant \$B\$-mode signal is expected to be due to the gravitational lensing of \$E\$-modes. We reject the null hypothesis of no \$B\$-mode polarization at a confidence of 3.1\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ including both statistical and systematic uncertainties. We test the consistency of the measured \$B\$-modes with the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$ Cold Dark Matter (\${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM}) framework by fitting for a single lensing amplitude parameter \$A\_L\$ relative to the Planck best-fit model prediction.

The {LF} array will be the final {AdvACT} array, replacing one of the {MF} arrays for a single season. Prior to the fabrication of the final {LF} detector array, we designed and characterized prototype {TES} bolometers. Detector geometries in these prototypes are varied in order to inform and optimize the bolometer designs for the {LF} array, which requires significantly lower noise levels and saturation powers (as low as ∼1∼1\{{\textbackslash}sim \}{\textbackslash},1 {pW}) than the higher-frequency detectors. Here we present results from tests of the first {LF} prototype {TES} detectors for {AdvACT}, including measurements of the saturation power, critical temperature, thermal conductance, and time constants.

We estimate that a decrease of more than one order of magnitude in time-constant should be possible with existing high-T/sub c/ thermometers. We give theoretical estimates of the performance gain with voltage bias for several bolometers that have been reported in the literature. We find cases where the sensitivity can be greatly improved (by changing the thermal conductance) while holding the time constant fixed and others where the bolometer can be made much faster while maintaining the sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Future cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) polarization experiments aim to measure an unprecedentedly small signal – the primordial gravity wave component of the polarization field B mode. To achieve this, they will analyse huge data sets, involving years of time-ordered data ({TOD}) from massively multi-detector focal planes. This creates the need for fast and precise methods to complement the maximum-likelihood ({ML}) approach in analysis pipelines. In this paper, we investigate fast map-making methods as applied to long duration, massively multi-detector, ground-based experiments, in the context of the search for B modes. We focus on two alternative map-making approaches: destriping and {TOD} filtering, comparing their performance on simulated multi-detector polarization data. We have written an optimized, parallel destriping code, the {DEStriping} {CARTographer} (descart), that is generalized for massive focal planes, including the potential effect of cross-correlated {TOD} 1/f noise. We also determine the scaling of computing time for destriping as applied to a simulated full-season data set for a realistic experiment. We find that destriping can outperform filtering in estimating both the large-scale E- and B-mode angular power spectra. In particular, filtering can produce significant spurious B-mode power via {EB} mixing. Whilst this can be removed, it contributes to the variance of B-mode bandpower estimates at scales near the primordial B-mode peak. For the experimental configuration we simulate, this has an effect on the possible detection significance for primordial B modes. Destriping is a viable alternative fast method to the full {ML} approach that does not cause the problems associated with filtering, and is flexible enough to fit into both {ML} and Monte Carlo pseudo-Cℓ pipelines.},

We next combine data from the {CMB}, {HST} Key Project, 2dF galaxy redshift survey, supernovae type Ia and big-bang nucleosynthesis. The Monte Carlo method allows the rapid investigation of a large number of parameters, and we present results from 6 and 9 parameter analyses of flat models, and an 11 parameter analysis of non-flat models. Our results include constraints on the neutrino mass (mν≲0.3eV), equation of state of the dark energy, and the tensor amplitude, as well as demonstrating the effect of additional parameters on the base parameter constraints. In a series of appendixes we describe the many uses of importance sampling, including computing results from new data and accuracy correction of results generated from an approximate method. We also discuss the different ways of converting parameter samples to parameter constraints, the effect of the prior, assess the goodness of fit and consistency, and describe the use of analytic marginalization over normalization parameters.},

We simulate synchrotron, thermal dust, free–free and anomalous microwave emission over the whole sky, in addition to the cosmic microwave background, and include a set of alternative prescriptions for the frequency dependence of each component, for example, polarized dust with multiple temperatures and a decorrelation of the signals with frequency, which introduce complexity that is consistent with current data. We also present a new prescription for adding small-scale realizations of these components at resolutions greater than current all-sky measurements. The usefulness of the code is demonstrated by forecasting the impact of varying foreground complexity on the recovered tensor-to-scalar ratio for the {LiteBIRD} satellite.

We implement it in the context of nearly full sky, multifrequency, B-mode polarization observations, incorporating statistical uncertainties due to the {CMB} sky statistics, instrumental noise, as well as the presence of the foreground signals. We model the effects of a subtraction of these using a parametric maximum likelihood technique and optimize the instrumental configuration with predefined or arbitrary observational frequency channels, constraining either a total number of detectors or a focal plane area. We showcase the proposed formalism by applying it to two cases of experimental setups based on the {CMBpol} and {COrE} mission concepts looked at as dedicated B-mode experiments. We find that, if the models of the foregrounds available at the time of the optimization are sufficiently precise, the procedure can help to either improve the potential scientific outcome of the experiment by a factor of a few, while allowing one to avoid excessive hardware complexity, or simplify the instrument design without compromising its science goals. However, our analysis also shows that even if the available foreground models are not considered to be sufficiently reliable, the proposed procedure can guide a design of more robust experimental setups. While better suited to cope with a plausible, greater complexity of the foregrounds than that foreseen by the models, these setups could ensure science results close to the best achievable, should the models be found to be correct.},

	abstract = {Recent results from the {BICEP}, Keck Array and Planck Collaborations demonstrate that Galactic foregrounds are an unavoidable obstacle in the search for evidence of inflationary gravitational waves in the cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) polarization. Beyond the foregrounds, the effect of lensing by intervening large-scale structure further obscures all but the strongest inflationary signals permitted by current data. With a plethora of ongoing and upcoming experiments aiming to measure these signatures, careful and self-consistent consideration of experiments' foreground- and lensing-removal capabilities is critical in obtaining credible forecasts of their performance. We investigate the capabilities of instruments such as Advanced {ACTPol}, {BICEP}3 and Keck Array, {CLASS}, {EBEX}10K, {PIPER}, Simons Array, {SPT}-3G and {SPIDER}, and projects as {COrE}+, {LiteBIRD}-ext, {PIXIE} and Stage {IV}, to clean contamination due to polarized synchrotron and dust from raw multi-frequency data, and remove lensing from the resulting co-added {CMB} maps (either using iterative {CMB}-only techniques or through cross-correlation with external data). Incorporating these effects, we present forecasts for the constraining power of these experiments in terms of inflationary physics, the neutrino sector, and dark energy parameters. Made publicly available through an online interface, this tool enables the next generation of {CMB} experiments to foreground-proof their designs, optimize their frequency coverage to maximize scientific output, and determine where cross-experimental collaboration would be most beneficial. We find that analyzing data from ground, balloon and space instruments in complementary combinations can significantly improve component separation performance, delensing, and cosmological constraints over individual datasets. In particular, we find that a combination of post-2020 ground- and space-based experiments could achieve constraints such as σ( r ) 1.3×10 −4 , σ( n t ) 0.03,σ( n s ) 1.8×10 −3 , σ(α s ) 1.7×10 −3 ,σ( M ν ) 31 {meV}, σ( w ) 0.09,σ( w 0 ) 0.25,0σ( w a ) 0.5,σ( N eff ) 0.024 and σ( Ω k ) 1.5×10 −3 , after component separation and iterative delensing.},

One key technology for such arrays is readout multiplexing: the ability to read out many sensors simultaneously on the same set of wires. This paper describes a frequency-domain multiplexed readout system which has been developed for and deployed on the {APEX}-{SZ} and South Pole Telescope millimeter wavelength receivers. In this system, the detector array is divided into modules of seven detectors, and each bolometer within the module is biased with a unique ∼{MHz} sinusoidal carrier such that the individual bolometer signals are well separated in frequency space. The currents from all bolometers in a module are summed together and pre-amplified with superconducting quantum interference devices operating at 4 K. Room temperature electronics demodulate the carriers to recover the bolometer signals, which are digitized separately and stored to disk. This readout system contributes little noise relative to the detectors themselves, is remarkably insensitive to unwanted microphonic excitations, and provides a technology pathway to multiplexing larger numbers of sensors.},

In particular, I will start with a simple, monolithic device model, moving to a more complex one involving discrete components, to finally move to today's more realistic, comprehensive model. In addition to the basic noise contribution (equilibrium Johnson noise and phonon noise), {TES} are significantly affected by extra noise, which is commonly referred to as “excess noise”. Different fundamental processes have been proposed and investigated to explain the origin of this excess noise, in particular near equilibrium non-linear Johnson noise, flux-flow noise, and internal thermal fluctuation noise. Experimental evidence shows that all three processes are real and contribute, at different levels, to the {TES} noise, although different processes become important at different regimes. It is therefore time to discard the term “excess noise” and consider these terms part of the “fundamental noise processes” instead.},

Several simple examples are given, and a general result is obtained for multimode detectors.

These lensing-induced {\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-modes constitute both a valuable probe of the dark matter distribution and an important contaminant for the extraction of the primary {CMB} {\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-modes from inflation. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} provides accurate nearly all-sky measurements of both the polarization {\textless}i{\textgreater}E{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-modes and the integrated mass distribution via the reconstruction of the {CMB} lensing potential. By combining these two data products, we have produced an all-sky template map of the lensing-induced {\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-modes using a real-space algorithm that minimizes the impact of sky masks. The cross-correlation of this template with an observed (primordial and secondary) {\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-mode map can be used to measure the lensing {\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-mode power spectrum at multipoles up to 2000. In particular, when cross-correlating with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-mode contribution directly derived from the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} polarization maps, we obtain lensing-induced {\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-mode power spectrum measurement at a significance level of 12{\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, which agrees with the theoretical expectation derived from the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} best-fit Λ cold dark matter model. This unique nearly all-sky secondary {\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-mode template, which includes the lensing-induced information from intermediate to small (10 ≲ {\textless}i{\textgreater}ℓ{\textless}i/{\textgreater} ≲ 1000) angular scales, is delivered as part of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} 2015 public data release. It will be particularly useful for experiments searching for primordial {\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-modes, such as {BICEP}2/Keck Array or {LiteBIRD}, since it will enable an estimate to be made of the lensing-induced contribution to the measured total {CMB} {\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-modes.},

	abstract = {We present a measurement of the \$B\$-mode polarization power spectrum (the \${BB}\$ spectrum) from 100 \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{deg\}{\textasciicircum}2\$ of sky observed with {SPTpol}, a polarization-sensitive receiver currently installed on the South Pole Telescope. The observations used in this work were taken during 2012 and early 2013 and include data in spectral bands centered at 95 and 150 {GHz}. We report the \${BB}\$ spectrum in five bins in multipole space, spanning the range \$300 {\textbackslash}le {\textbackslash}ell {\textbackslash}le 2300\$, and for three spectral combinations: 95 {GHz} \${\textbackslash}times\$ 95 {GHz}, 95 {GHz} \${\textbackslash}times\$ 150 {GHz}, and 150 {GHz} \${\textbackslash}times\$ 150 {GHz}. We subtract small (\${\textless} 0.5 {\textbackslash}sigma\$ in units of statistical uncertainty) biases from these spectra and account for the uncertainty in those biases. The resulting power spectra are inconsistent with zero power but consistent with predictions for the \${BB}\$ spectrum arising from the gravitational lensing of \$E\$-mode polarization. If we assume no other source of \${BB}\$ power besides lensed \$B\$ modes, we determine a preference for lensed \$B\$ modes of \$4.9 {\textbackslash}sigma\$. After marginalizing over tensor power and foregrounds, namely polarized emission from galactic dust and extragalactic sources, this significance is \$4.3 {\textbackslash}sigma\$. Fitting for a single parameter, \$A\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{lens\}\$, that multiplies the predicted lensed \$B\$-mode spectrum, and marginalizing over tensor power and foregrounds, we find \$A\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{lens\} = 1.08 {\textbackslash}pm 0.26\$, indicating that our measured spectra are consistent with the signal expected from gravitational lensing. The data presented here provide the best measurement to date of the \$B\$-mode power spectrum on these angular scales.},

	abstract = {We present measurements of polarization lensing using the 150 {GHz} maps which include all data taken by the {BICEP}2 \& Keck Array {CMB} polarization experiments up to and including the 2014 observing season ({BK}14). Despite their modest angular resolution (\${\textbackslash}sim 0.5{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$), the excellent sensitivity (\${\textbackslash}sim 3{\textbackslash}mu\$K-arcmin) of these maps makes it possible to directly reconstruct the lensing potential using only information at larger angular scales (\${\textbackslash}ell{\textbackslash}leq 700\$). From the auto-spectrum of the reconstructed potential we measure an amplitude of the spectrum to be \$A{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}phi{\textbackslash}phi\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm L\}=1.15{\textbackslash}pm 0.36\$ (Planck \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} prediction corresponds to \$A{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}phi{\textbackslash}phi\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm L\}=1\$), and reject the no-lensing hypothesis at 5.8\${\textbackslash}sigma\$, which is the highest significance achieved to date using an {EB} lensing estimator. Taking the cross-spectrum of the reconstructed potential with the Planck 2015 lensing map yields \$A{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}phi{\textbackslash}phi\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm L\}=1.13{\textbackslash}pm 0.20\$. These direct measurements of \$A{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}phi{\textbackslash}phi\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm L\}\$ are consistent with the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} cosmology, and with that derived from the previously reported {BK}14 B-mode auto-spectrum (\$A{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rm {BB}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm L\}=1.20{\textbackslash}pm 0.17\$). We perform a series of null tests and consistency checks to show that these results are robust against systematics and are insensitive to analysis choices. These results unambiguously demonstrate that the B-modes previously reported by {BICEP} / Keck at intermediate angular scales (\$150{\textbackslash}lesssim{\textbackslash}ell{\textbackslash}lesssim 350\$) are dominated by gravitational lensing. The good agreement between the lensing amplitudes obtained from the lensing reconstruction and B-mode spectrum starts to place constraints on any alternative cosmological sources of B-modes at these angular scales.},

We construct minimum variance estimators of the intervening mass distribution out of the six quadratic combinations of the temperature and polarization fields. Polarization begins to assist in the reconstruction when E-mode mapping becomes possible on degree-scale fields, i.e. for an experiment with a noise level of {\textasciitilde}40 {uK}-arcmin and beam of {\textasciitilde}7', similar to the Planck experiment; surpasses the temperature reconstruction at {\textasciitilde}26 {uK}-arcmin and 4'; yet continues to improve the reconstruction until the lensing B-modes are mapped to l {\textasciitilde} 2000 at {\textasciitilde}0.3 {uK}-arcmin and 3'. Ultimately, the correlation between the E and B modes can provide a high signal-to-noise mass map out to multipoles of L {\textasciitilde} 1000, extending the range of temperature-based estimators by nearly an order of magnitude. We outline four applications of mass reconstruction: measurement of the linear power spectrum in projection to the cosmic variance limit out to L {\textasciitilde} 1000 (or wavenumbers 0.002 {\textless} k {\textless} 0.2 in h/Mpc), cross-correlation with cosmic shear surveys to probe the evolution of structure tomographically, cross-correlation of the mass and temperature maps to probe the dark energy, and the separation of lensing and gravitational wave B-modes.},

	abstract = {Using the formalism of spin-weighted functions we present an all-sky analysis of polarization in the Cosmic Microwave Background ({CMB}). Linear polarization is a second-rank symmetric and traceless tensor, which can be decomposed on a sphere into spin \${\textbackslash}pm 2\$ spherical harmonics. These are the analog of the spherical harmonics used in the temperature maps and obey the same completeness and orthogonality relations. We show that there exist two linear combinations of spin \${\textbackslash}pm 2\$ multipole moments which have opposite parities and can be used to fully characterize the statistical properties of polarization in the {CMB}. Magnetic-type parity combination does not receieve contributions from scalar modes and does not cross-correlate with either temperature or electric-type parity combination, so there are four different power spectra that fully characterize statistical properties of {CMB}. We present their explicit expressions for scalar and tensor modes in the form of line of sight integral solution and numerically evaluate them for a representative set of models. These general solutions differ from the expressions obtained previously in the small scale limit both for scalar and tensor modes. A method to generate and analyze all sky maps of temperature and polarization is given and the optimal estimators for various power spectra and their corresponding variances are discussed.},
